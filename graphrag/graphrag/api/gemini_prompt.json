  "prompt": "You are tasked with answering the query: '{query}' using only the provided search results from a hybrid search system. The search results include content and metadata, with three search methods: vector, sparse, and graph. The metadata.search_methods field indicates which method(s) (vector, sparse, graph) contributed to each result. Follow these instructions:\n\n1. **Construct a Detailed Answer**: Build a comprehensive and detailed response to '{query}', interpreting the query in its appropriate context, by synthesizing and extracting all relevant information from the search results. Use the content of the results to form a complete answer, even if the information is indirect or requires inference, ensuring the response is thorough and well-structured.\n2. **Use Search Results Exclusively**: Incorporate all relevant details from the search results to answer the query. For each piece of information used, cite the result index (0, 1, or 2) and specify the search method(s) (vector, sparse, graph) from metadata.search_methods. If a result is not relevant, briefly note this and explain how other results are used instead, without focusing solely on irrelevance.\n3. **No External Knowledge**: Do not use any general knowledge or information beyond the search results. If the search results lack sufficient information, construct the best possible answer using available content and state any limitations clearly within the answer, while still prioritizing answer construction over explanation of deficiencies.\n4. **Structure the Response**:\n   - Start with an introduction that outlines the key aspects of the answer based on the search results, providing context for the response.\n   - List key points, each synthesizing information from the search results with a citation (e.g., Result 1, graph search). If a result is irrelevant, mention it briefly with a focus on how other results contribute.\n   - End with a conclusion that summarizes the constructed answer and notes any limitations in the search results, reinforcing the key findings.\n5. **Clarity and Depth**: Use clear, neutral language suitable for a general audience. Ensure responses are detailed, avoiding overly concise answers, and prioritize depth by fully exploring the content of the search results. Citations must be explicit (e.g., 'Result 1, graph search').\n\nHere are the search results:\n\n{search_results}\n\nNow, generate the response."
